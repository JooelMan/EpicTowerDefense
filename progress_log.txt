Interim reports:

17.3.
The initial commit contains maybe a little too much information because I recreated the git project after realising that I added gitignore file a bit too late to keep the git repository nice and clean.
Classes: Game, GameObject, Tower, Enemy, Ticker and FileManager have been added to the project. Game class draws simple 2D graphics program and has an update function that calls every gameObjects' update function.
Ticker calls Game class' update function repeatedly. GameObject class contains basic information, such as coordinates and id, about each GameObject. There is also update function which is abstract.
Enemy and Tower classes have implementations of GameObject class' abstract variables and functions. At this point, there is no code at all in FileManager object.
Every method works properly and there has been little to none difficulties. I am lagging a little bit behind the plan because I have spent only about 5 hours doing this project.

31.3.
I have added game maps' file handling to FileManager and Game classes. This is not fully ready yet because it cannot handle files which do not follow strictly the expected format.
PathTile, SpawnTile and EndTile classes have also been added to the project. I have also started implemententing Enemy objects' movement.
I have faced some minor issues when implementing the movement, but I am pretty sure that I just have to rethink my code implementation to get the problems solved. In addition, I added a simple map text file for test purposes.
I have not been able to work on this project for very long during last weeks and that is why I am still lagging behind the plan. However, I have planned to spend some time doing this project for a next few days.
Last two weeks I worked only about 5 hours on this project.

14.4.
I created a better version for map files and map file handling. I finished Enemy objects' movement and implemented their deletion when they reach the end of the path.
Besides, I added game pausing feature. Lastly, I added tower's building feature and their collision with path and each other so that one can only place towers on top of a grass.
Tower's building feature has been tested with GUI and it works properly. Map files' handling is not ready yet. It requires wrong file format handling and testing.
The previous map file type made it difficult to assign right target path tiles to each PathTile, so I had to create a new map file type.
I used approximately 20 hours on this project on these last two weeks and I am still lagging a little bit behind the plan.
